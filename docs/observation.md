Details on the the FOXSI-4 flight and observation. This page will help a user decide and understand the inputs they need for their relevant response components when using the response files and/or [Response-tools](https://foxsi.github.io/response-tools) code.

More comming soon...

## Choosing a source location

Relevant for functions with inputs like: `off_axis_angle`, `region`, `pitch`.

## Choosing a time range

Relevant for functions with inputs like: `time_range`.

## Choosing energies

<span style="color:#e16b27"><b style='color:#e16b27 !important;'>For the vast majority of uses,</b> the energies <em style='color:#e16b27 !important;'>should</em> come from those defined by the redistribution matrix (RMF) relevant to the telescope a user is investigating. If a user is only working with 1D response elements (e.g., effective areas, transmission, etc.) they might want to supply their own energies; <b style='color:#e16b27 !important;'>however, a great deal of care should be taken</b>.</span>

Relevant for functions with inputs like: `mid_energies`.
